__Abstract__: Embedded intelligence(EI) is characterized as the ability of a product, process, or service to reflect on its own operational performance, usage load, or environment. The motivation for this may be to enhance the performance, lifetime, or quality of the product.  
Embedded intelligence can serve many purposes:  
- The monitoring of the health and usage of products and high-value assets.  
- The ease of use of a product, system, or service.  
- The market appeal and acceptance where a product becomes fashionable, an example of which would be the tablet which regained popularity by the addition of enhanced services, ergonomic design in terms of shape and functionality, and enhanced aesthetics.  
- The ability for a service, system, or product to be used by aging, disabled, or previously socially excluded people.
