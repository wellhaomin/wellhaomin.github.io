Abstract: This is a description of Artificial General Intelligence(AGI).  

__An artificial general intelligence (AGI)__ is a hypothetical intelligent agent which can understand or learn any intellectual task that human beings or other animals can. AGI has also been defined alternatively as autonomous systems that surpass human capabilities at the majority of economically valuable work. Developing AGI is a primary goal of some artificial intelligence research and for several AI companies such as _OpenAI, DeepMind, and Anthropic_, as well as a common topic in science fiction and futures studies.
