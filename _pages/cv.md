* __2022.02 - 2022.06 Graduation Projection__
* __“ Development of a Portable System for Human Physiological Parameter Detection”__
* __Works:__
  - Implemented the normal operation of each functional module and transfer data __(C Language)__;
  - Displayed the detection data on the Phone __(JAVA)__;
  - The developed portable system demonstrates high accuracy in detecting human physiological parameters, which is in line with the data obtained by smartwatches available in the market. The system was designed to be user-friendly and able to collect and process signals related to heart rate, blood oxygen saturation, and body temperature, which are then transmitted to an upper computer application for display.

* __2021.02 Mathematical Contest in Modelling [Honorable Mention]__
* __Works:__
  - Role: Team leader;
  - Took responsible for programming part: __Matlab__;
  - The topic is about how to solve the problem of fighting wildfires in the Australia by using SSA drones and Radio Repeater drones;
  - Based on Cellular Automata System, the trend of bushfires in Victoria of eastern region is at great risk of fire;
  - Based on Grey Prediction Model (1,1), predict the change of SSA drones and RadioRepeater drones’ maintenance costs, the average error is small, which verifies that the model has high accuracy.

* __2019.07 - 2020.11 RoboCup China Open [National Second Prize]__
* __Works:__
   - Utilized Ubuntu to optimize the codes and parameters of different motions and paths of five robots based on the open source code of B-human; 
   - Compared CodeRelease B-human2018, 2019 and robots NAO V5, V6;
   - Took responsibility for the Defender’s code, conducted site planning and decisionmaking deployment, which cooperated with Keeper to block the enemy's goals;
